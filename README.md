## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Build:

This template comes equipped with a `.github/workflows` directory containing a `main.yaml` file. With this setup, GameCI is configured to automatically generate a Windows executable build from the repository. This build process is triggered as soon as any push commit is made to the `main` and `QA` branch. This ensures that you always have an up-to-date build ready for testing and deployment, streamlining your development and QA processes.
